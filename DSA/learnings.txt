📘 DSA SHORT QUESTIONS WITH ANSWERS

⸻

🔹 Prefix Sum & Two Pointers

Q1. What is a prefix sum array?
Ans: A prefix sum array stores the cumulative sum of elements such that each index contains the sum of all elements before it including itself.

⸻

Q2. Why is prefix sum used?
Ans: It is used to answer range or subarray sum queries in constant time after preprocessing.

⸻

Q3. How do you find subarray sum using prefix sum?
Ans: Subarray sum from index l to r is calculated as prefix[r] − prefix[l−1].

⸻

Q4. What is the time complexity of building a prefix sum array?
Ans: O(n)

⸻

Q5. When is the two-pointer technique used?
Ans: It is used when the array or list is sorted to reduce time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).

⸻

Q6. What is the time complexity of Two Sum II?
Ans: O(n)

⸻

🔹 String Algorithms

Q7. What is a substring?
Ans: A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters taken from a string.

⸻

Q8. What is a subsequence?
Ans: A subsequence is a sequence derived by deleting zero or more characters without changing order.

⸻

Q9. Difference between substring and subsequence?
Ans: Substring must be contiguous, while subsequence can skip characters.

⸻

Q10. What does split() do?
Ans: It divides a string into a list based on a specified delimiter.

⸻

Q11. What does join() do?
Ans: It joins elements of a list into a single string using a delimiter.

⸻

⸻

Q31. How do you find the middle of a linked list?
Ans: By using slow and fast pointers technique.

⸻

Q32. What is Floyd’s cycle detection algorithm?
Ans: An algorithm using two pointers to detect a loop in a linked list.

Ans: A linked list where the last node points back to the first node.

⸻

🔹 Hashing Techniques
